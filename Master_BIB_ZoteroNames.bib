The framework integrates computational fluid dynamics for wind load evaluation with a finite element method to perform a linear time history analysis. A deep neural network surrogate model is developed to reduce the computational cost required for objective function evaluation. The optimization problem is defined to minimize structural material usage while adhering to performance constraints based on the PBWD described in the ASCE prestandards through using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II to derive the multi-objective optimization process. Finally, a nonlinear time history analysis is employed to predict the inelastic behaviour of tall buildings based on the prestandards assumptions to quantify the differences that can be generated using the developed framework. To ensure the proposed framework's effectiveness and practicality, a case study of a standard tall building is presented.<br/></div> © 2025 The Authors},

  abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Wind energy is a crucial component of the global transition to renewable energy, and enhancing the performance, reliability, and cost-efficiency of wind turbines is key to their widespread adoption. One of the most important aspects of turbine reliability is the design of the main bearing system, which supports the drivetrain and experiences significant mechanical loads. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the TRB-TRB (tapered roller bearings in O‑configuration) main bearing system, focusing on how variations in roller diameter, load angle, and bearing geometry affect load distribution, contact pressure, rating life, and overall cost efficiency. Using Finite Element analysis from thyssenkrupp Rothe Erde, the study systematically examines a generic 6 MW onshore turbine drivetrain with roller diameters ranging from 60 to 100 mm and load angles between 5 and 40°. The results demonstrate that optimized configurations significantly reduce manufacturing costs while maintaining technical integrity. These findings highlight the effectiveness of early-stage design optimization for achieving better cost efficiency, in line with the "Design-to-Cost" approach. By combining technical simulation with economic analysis, the study provides a comprehensive framework for improving wind turbine main bearing systems. The insights from this research are particularly valuable for designing more efficient and cost-effective turbines, especially as turbines grow in size and capacity. Although the primary focus is on onshore wind turbines, the methods and findings could also be applied to offshore environments, where further research could explore the impact of harsher operational conditions on bearing performance.<br/></div> © Der/die Autor(en), exklusiv lizenziert an Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland, ein Teil von Springer Nature 2025.},

This approach adopts a top-down strategy, initiating a preliminary global design in the form of a space truss and integrating structural and fabrication constraints specific to I3DCP. A form-dependent self-weight load is applied throughout the form-finding process until the structure achieves static equilibrium. As the current I3DCP setup is mounted on a robotic arm with a stationary base, the feasibility of the designed structure for I3DCP is assessed, ensuring compatibility with the robotic arm's workspace. Structures exceeding the workspace boundaries are segmented and individually optimised, subject to topological and geometrical constraints. The optimised segments are then merged into a single assembly to complete the process. This approach is demonstrated through the design and construction of a 3-metre-span pedestrian bridge.

  abstract = {In the aerospace sector, weight reduction is crucial for enhancing performance and efficiency. Significant advantages of using Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) in structural designs include the weight saving potential by leveraging their favorable strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios, as well as their ability to modulate properties through strategic laminate design. Traditional composite design methods often depend on constant-stiffness, utilizing quasi-isotropic layouts with uniform fiber orientation angles across each layer. Although this method preserves structural integrity, it does not fully leverage the potential of advanced composite materials and fiber placement technologies for weight minimization. Introducing variable fiber directions can achieve further weight reductions. However, this expanded design flexibility introduces new challenges and necessitates automation in the design process. This paper builds on these concepts, presenting a novel approach to structural design using Variable Angle Tow (VAT) laminates for Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) manufacturing. Specifically tailored for complex double-curved components, this method aims to optimize weight and reduce manual effort while simultaneously maintaining or enhancing structural performance and ensuring manufacturability. It encompasses an automated nested loop optimization process utilizing Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and algorithmic design to fine-tune the orientation and curvature of splines, as well as the thickness of individual layers, thereby achieving mass reduction. The entire process effectively bridges the gap between design and manufacturing, from the initial CAD model import of the part surface to the generation of executable robot control code. The method is applied to a 2D plate and a double-curved 3D wing shell under exemplary loading conditions. Weight reductions of up to 7.44% were achieved compared to classical laminates. These exemplary results, while dependent on specific components and load cases, demonstrate the efficacy of the method and the potential for weight savings in aerospace structures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The current research aims to analyze the shape and structural features of the eggs of the lepidoptera species Melitaea sp. (Lepidoptera, Nympalidae) and develop design solutions through the implementation of a novel strategy of biomimetic design. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the chorion reveals a medial zone that forms an arachnoid grid resembling a ribbed dome with convex longitudinal ribs and concave transverse ring members. A parametric design algorithm was created with the aid of computer-aided design (CAD) software Rhinoceros 3D and Grasshopper3D in order to abstract and emulate the biological model. A series of physical models were manufactured with variations in geometric parameters like the number of ribs and rings, their thickness, and curvature. Selective laser sintering (SLS) technology and Polyamide12 (nylon) material were utilized for the prototyping process. Quasi-static compression testing was carried out in conjunction with finite element analysis (FEA) to investigate the deformation patterns and stress dispersion of the models. The biomimetic ribbed dome appears to significantly dampen the snap-through behavior that is observed in typical solid and lattice domes, decreasing dynamic stresses developed during the response and preventing catastrophic failure of the structure. Increasing the curvature of the ring segments further reduces the snap-through phenomenon and improves the overall strength. However, excessive curvature has a negative effect on the maximum sustained load. Increasing the number and thickness of the transverse rings and the number of the longitudinal ribs also increases the strength of the dome. However, excessive increase in the rib radius leads to more acute snap-through behavior and an earlier failure. The above results were validated using respective finite element analyses. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  Abstract = {Design: optimization of the large-scale composite wind turbine blade during conceptual design is one of the key processes of the cost decreasing and benefit increasing for current wind power industry. It however, still remains several key issues, such as lack of a fully parametric process, suffering from a huge computational burden and being easily trapped into local optimum. To remedy these issues, this paper proposes a design optimization method for composite wind turbine blade using Complete Constrained Expected Improvement-Subset Simulation Optimization (CCEI-SSO). A fully parametric Finite Element Analysis (FEA) coded by ANSYS parametric design language of the composite wind turbine blade is firstly proposed, which can be linked to an arbitrary optimization method to form a unified joint simulation framework. To enhance the performance of the optimization process, CCEI-SSO is further proposed, where an adaptive Kriging model leveraging CCEI infill strategy is deeply coupled into each simulation level of SSO to keep balance of optimality and feasibility within very limited number of real FEAs. Inheriting from the random nature within SSO, local optimum is well avoided as well. A case of the design optimization of a 10 MW wind turbine blade is considered to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.},

In this study, one of the critical (load bearing) components of automobiles, i.e., the suspension control arm made of steel, is fully redesigned for its suitable manufacturing using composite materials. To this end, innovative mechanical simulation methods are developed and coupled to perform the design, analysis, and optimization of the automotive suspension control arm. The main design/optimization criteria are set to reduce no less than 75% weight of the metal control arm and increase its safety by at least 60% by using composite materials and a new geometry suitable for mass production. To predict the deformation-stress state of the control arm, a four-node quadrilateral shell element is implemented based on the kinematics of refined zigzag theory (RZT). Once verified numerically, the computer implementation of the RZT is combined with the optimization algorithm to achieve the optimum laminate stacking sequence of the control arm. Accordingly, prototypes of the composite control arms with optimum lamination plans are manufactured and then experimentally tested under the loading and constraint conditions defined at the conceptual design stage. The numerical and full-scale experimental results are compared, and the RZT models are comprehensively validated. Hence, the advantages of the overarching design-analysis-optimization strategy presented herein are revealed for redesigning and manufacturing automobile parts from composite materials.<br/></div> © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

This approach can be effectively applied to the conceptual design phase of the structures with various design objectives under conservative loads. It allows us to adjust the design parameters in real time during the design phase and to obtain the resultant forms immediately. Based on a certain selection strategy, the forms have a better state of internal membrane forces compared to the original spherical structure. An ANSYS Parameter Design Language (APDL)-based automatic geometric modelling method for mega-latticed structures with various surface forms is developed. The proposed method solves the problem that the existing modelling methods are only available for spherical structures. It is highly applicable for modelling mega-latticed structures with spherical, cylindrical, and other heterogeneous surfaces. Furthermore, a complete design workflow that combines the proposed form-finding approach (for conceptual design), the automatic geometric modelling method (for transformation), and the finite element method (for deepening design and analysis), is discussed.

  abstract = {This study aimed to improve the mechanical properties of 3D concept designs by combining the design capability of a generative adversarial network with finite element analysis. This approach offers an innovative perspective on the conditioning of generative models while improving design properties and automation. A new design and evaluation framework has been developed for GAN models to generate 3D models with improved mechanical properties. The framework is an iterative process that includes dataset generation, GAN training, and finite element analysis. A “joint” component used in the aerospace industry is considered to demonstrate the proposed method’s effectiveness. Over six iterations, an increase of 20% is recorded in the average safety factor of the designs, and the variety of designs produced is narrowed in the desired direction. These findings suggest that the direct generation of structural components with generative models can expand the potential of deep learning in engineering design. Another innovative aspect of this study is that it provides a new option for the conditioning of data-dependent generative design models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  Abstract = {Material called polymer-matrix composites (PMCs) have become very important in modern industry because it is strong and light. To get the most out of them, structure construction must be optimized and advanced testing methods must be used. In this brief, the strategies and methods for improving the performance, lowering prices, and speeding up the production process of PMCs through structural design and prototyping are explained. Optimizing structural design starts with having a full idea of the qualities of the materials and how well they need to work. Engineers can model different load situations and make designs better and better until they reach the best setups by using advanced computer tools like finite element analysis (FEA) and computer-aided design (CAD). Using design for manufacturability (DFM) principles also makes sure that the end product can be made with little waste and expense. At the same time, testing methods are very important for making sure that ideas work and for speeding up the development process. Rapid development technologies, such as 3D printing, make it possible to make complex PMC parts much more quickly and accurately than ever before. By making many prototypes quickly, engineers can quickly see if the plan is possible, find any problems, and make any changes that are needed before starting mass production. In addition, using automatic manufacturing methods speeds up output and makes it more consistent. Automated layup methods, like automated tape laying (ATL) and automated fiber placement (AFP), make sure that fibers are oriented correctly and that mistakes are kept to a minimum. This leads to better mechanical features and repeatability. The progress in printing multiple materials now lets us make mixed structures with customized material qualities at the microscale, which gives us even more design options for PMCs. When engineers carefully mix different materials, they can get beneficial effects and get the best results for certain tasks.},

  abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">This paper presents a Generative Design Method (GDM) for highly customised Cultural Heritage applications concerning the exhibition and conservation of pottery. As a fundamental requirement, archaeological finds must be preserved in their structural integrity. Additionally, when present, the exposition supports must be aesthetically pleasant meaning that they must be non-invasive in the field of view of the observer. Furthermore, each artefact presents a unique geometry, hence its supporting structure must be designed accordingly. The proposed GDM considers these requirements, adopting a synergy of CAD, CAE, and optimisation tools. It is developed through two phases. The first phase, P<inf>1</inf>, concerns with the structural integrity of the fragment. In this phase, a Parametric Modelling approach is chosen for its ease of use both in the Finite Element Analysis evaluations of artefacts and in the design and optimisations of feasible supporting structures. The output of the phase P<inf>1</inf> is the optimised configuration of the functional elements of the support ('C<inf>i</inf> ') which are the interface region between the support itself and the fragment of pottery. They represent the input of the second phase, P<inf>2</inf>, that aims to generate lightweight concepts for the complete supporting structure considering the optimal 'C<inf>i</inf> ' configuration. During this phase, an aesthetics criterion (related to the minimisation of the support's visibility) is also considered to achieve non-invasive supporting structures. Doing so, the GDM provides informed decisions in the early stages of the design activities with a simulation driven approach oriented to manufacturing. In this way, users are able to focus on design requirements since the concept's variants are generated by means of an optimised configuration of standardised components ('C<inf>i</inf>') and obstacle geometries.<br/></div> © 2023 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cad-journal.net.},

The adoption of a novel ECS architecture, based on an electrically-driven vapor compression cycle system, can enable a twofold increase of coefficient of performance at cruise conditions, as compared to the conventional air cycle machine. The core of this technology is a high-speed, miniature centrifugal compressor, consisting of two impellers mounted in back-to-back configuration, and running on gas bearings, operating with refrigerant. The fluid dynamic design optimization of the twin-stage compressor, to be installed in the vapor compression cycle test rig under realization at Delft University of Technology, is documented in this paper. First, the scaling analysis for centrifugal compressor is extended to provide guidelines for the design of twin-stage machines. Then, a multi-objective conceptual design optimization is performed by resorting to an in-house reduced-order model (ROM), coupled to a genetic algorithm. The fluid dynamic performance and the structural integrity of the optimal design are assessed by means of a hybrid framework, encompassing computational fluid dynamics and ROMs, and by finite element analysis. The results show that it is possible to design a twin-stage compressor for the target application, featuring an average efficiency higher than 70%, a maximum compression ratio exceeding 9, and an operating range of 0.27 at the design rotational speed, despite the detrimental effects of motor cooling and miniature size.<br/></div> Copyright © 2023 by ASME.},

This parameterization concept is not novel in principle, but it is embedded here in a complex high-fidelity optimization process and proven for a high-dimensional design space. The design software is used initially to generate a parametric model of a three-dimensional transport aircraft configuration. To streamline the actual optimization process, the computer-aided design model is replaced with a parametric reduced order model based on proper orthogonal decomposition that is capable of predicting discrete surface displacement fields as a function of the design parameters. During the optimization, surface displacements are computed according to the current design parameters and applied on the baseline shape. In every optimization step, the aircraft's steady-state equilibrium of forces and moments are satisfied by a trimming algorithm and the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver TAU is coupled with a linear structural finite-element method model. Gradients are computed analytically using geometric sensitivities provided by the reduced order model and by applying the adjoint method to the flow solver and the mesh deformation tool. The workflow is embedded within FlowSimulator, a multiphysics environment for high performance computing. The optimization process is demonstrated for a high-dimensional wing parameterization with 126 degrees of freedom. The aircraft cruise drag could be significantly reduced by 6% on a series of three continuously refined meshes for the aerodynamic analysis. For an accurate representation of the optimal shape by the computer-aided design software after the optimization, the approximation error introduced by the reduced order modelling approach must be sufficiently small. Therefore, the accuracy of the predictions was analyzed. The results identify the main source of the geometric error and quantify their effect on the drag reduction gained by the optimization. We dedicate this article to the memory of our colleague and friend Arno Ronzheimer, whose devotion to CAD modeling was unsurpassed.<br/></div> © 2023, The Author(s).},

Digital design tools in this domain often lack proper communication between different stages of design and relevant domain knowledge. Furthermore, decisions made in the early stages of design, where sketching is used to initiate, develop, and communicate ideas, heavily impact later stages, resulting in the need for rapid feedback to the architectural designer so they can proceed with adequate knowledge about design implications. Accordingly, this paper presents research on a novel integrative design framework based on a recently developed 4D sketching interface, targeted for architectural design as a form-finding tool coupled with three modules: (1) a Geometric Modelling module, which utilises Points2Surf as a machine learning model for automatic surface mesh reconstruction from the point clouds produced by sketches, (2) a Material Modelling module, which predicts the mechanical properties of biocomposites based on multiscale micromechanics homogenisation techniques, and (3) a Structural Analysis module, which assesses the mechanical performance of the meshed structure on the basis of the predicted material properties using finite element simulations. The proposed framework is a step towards using material-informed design already in the early stages of design.<br/></div> © 2023 The Author(s)},

In this paper, a wheel finite element analysis model combining shell-body elements is established, and a design and optimization method for an assembled wheel with a magnesium alloy rim-Aluminum alloy spoke structure is proposed. Based on the advanced grid deformation technology and implicit parameterization technology, the assembled wheel fatigue analysis parametric model is created, DOE sampling is carried out, and the design variables are screened out by combining the contribution analysis method. A hybrid method of entropy weighted grey relation analysis (EGRA) combined with modified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (MNSGA-II) is proposed for multi-objective optimization of the assembled wheel in combination with an approximate model approach to obtain the Pareto frontier solution set and its grey relation order to filter the preferred compromise solution. The simulation analysis compares and optimizes various performance indicators of the front and rear assembled wheels, and is verified by bending and radial fatigue tests. The results show that the weight of the wheel is reduced by 10.17%, and the weight reduction effect is remarkable.

As tall buildings are growing rapidly, engineering science is experiencing developments such as the finite-element method. The present research creates a platform for architects using the topology optimization method as an assistant designer. This platform serves as a starter for a common language of these two professions in the early stages of design. Architects can use this platform to produce the final topological optimized form by defining their shape plans, lateral loads, height, and the target ratio of models as platform inputs. This paper highlights the importance of the bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization method simultaneously in architectural and structural contexts to reduce the total weight of the structure while keeping the displacement of the structure in an acceptable range. The reduction will be made by eliminating the structural material zones with lower stress with an effective method for achieving the structural efficiency of a tall building, considering architectural aspects. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The present work is focused on the analysis of the microstructure of the exoskeleton of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and the extraction of design concepts by implementing geometrically described 3D Voronoi diagrams. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of dried sea urchin shells revealed a foam-like microstructure, also known as the stereom. Subsequently, parametric, digital models were created with the aid of the computer-aided design (CAD) software Rhinoceros 3D (v. Rhino 7, 7.1.20343.09491) combined with the visual programming environment Grasshopper. Variables such as node count, rod thickness and mesh smoothness of the biologically-inspired Voronoi lattice were adapted for 3D printing cubic specimens using the fused filament fabrication (FFF) method. The filaments used in the process were a commercial polylactic acid (PLA), a compound of polylactic acid/polyhydroxyalkanoate (PLA/PHA) and a wood fiber polylactic acid/polyhydroxyalkanoate (PLA/PHA) composite. Nanoindentation tests coupled with finite element analysis (FEA) produced the stress–strain response of the materials under study and were used to simulate the Voronoi geometries under a compression loading regime in order to study their deformation and stress distribution in relation to experimental compression testing. The PLA blend with polyhydroxyalkanoate seems to have a minor effect on the mechanical behavior of such structures, whereas when wood fibers are added to the compound, a major decrease in strength occurs. The computational model results significantly coincide with the experimental results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  Abstract = {To increase the payload, reduce energy consumption, improve work efficiency and therefore must accordingly reduce the total hull weight of the submersible. This paper introduces a design optimization process for the pressurehull of submarines under uniform external hydrostatic pressure using both finite element analysis (FEA) and optimization tools. A comprehensive study about the optimum design of the pressure hull, to minimize the weight and increase the volume, to reach minimum buoyancy factor and maximum operating depth minimizing the buoyancy factor (B.F) is taken as an objective function with constraints of plate and frame yielding, general instability and deflection. The optimization process contains many design variables such as pressure-hull plate thickness, unsupported spacing, dimensions of long and ring beams and finally the elliptical submersible pressure-hull diameters. The optimization process was conducted using ANSYS parametric design language (APDL) and ISIGHT. The Multi-Island Genetic Algorithm (G.A) is considered to conduct the optimization process. Additionally, parametric analysis is done on the pressure hull to examine the effect of different design variables on the pressure-hull design. As a result, the B.F of the proposed optimal model is reduced by an average of 31.78\% compared with Reference Model (RM). Maximum von Mises stress is reduced by 27\% as well. These results can be helpful for submarine pressure-hull designers.},

  abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">This paper proposes a novel bridge design approach based on multi-material topology optimization, which realizes the process from conceptual design to detailed design, and an innovative bridge form is obtained with the proposed approach. In the present study, the multi-material bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (MBESO) method, which is developed from the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) method, is used as the algorithm which can effectively handle topology optimization problems involving multiple materials. Since the method assigns two different materials to the tension and compression members in a structure, it is particularly suitable for designing bridge structures composed of steel and concrete. A three-span bridge with a main span of 350 m is used as an example to apply the MBESO method for the topology optimization design, and a set of techniques are introduced, such as the variation of the design domain, the utilization of symmetry, the selection of the non-design domain and the consideration of multiple load cases, to obtain multiple optimization results. By comprehensively studying the functionality, ease of construction, and aesthetic properties, a competitive result is selected as the proposed conceptual design for the bridge, and then a detailed design, including an implementable construction process, is achieved and verified by finite element analysis. The comparison between the proposed bridge and other typical bridge types based on technical and economic indicators clearly shows the obvious advantages of the new type of bridge design. This research work realizes the whole process to obtain the detailed design of a new bridge type from the form-finding with the MBESO method, revealing the considerable value of applying multi-material topology optimization to the design of practical long-span bridges.<br/></div> © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

This study presents the design of a novel bidirectional mechanical metamaterial with tunable stiffness and energy dissipation. By leveraging the phenomenon of Coulomb friction, the metamaterial dissipates energy when a small gap closes and two walls slide across one another under planar loading. The conceptual design of the metamaterial is parameterized, so the material behavior can be tailored to a particular application. A computational framework is built, using finite element analysis and a multi-objective genetic algorithm to maximize the volumetric energy dissipation such that the unit cell does not undergo plastic deformation. The finite element mesh used in this analysis is first parametrically optimized to minimize simulation time while remaining within a global error threshold. The optimal unit cell is arrayed into a bulk material, formed into a hollow cylinder, and simulated under a compression cycle for different metamaterial densities. A prototype of the hollow cylinder is 3D printed via fused deposition modeling and is tested. Both the simulated and experimental results demonstrate the repeatability of the energy-dissipating property with a strong correlation.<br/></div> © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

This research study attempts to use environmental data revealed by NASA and its habitat design requirements to develop a conceptual design for an innovative habitation form and then simulate it with Mars conditions to analyze the habitation shell's structural behavior according to finite element analysis. In this regard, research phases, including layout configuration, form-finding, and structural analysis, have been conducted to explore a habitation concept implemented with generative design tools as a decision-maker in extreme conditions. In conclusion, two generated typologies of proposed habitation forms will be compared in terms of their structural performance under extreme loads of the martian environment.

  abstract = {The demand for new structural concept design of automotive parts has grown with weight reduction and improvement of crash safety in automotive industry. In this study, the established local patchwork hot stamping technology was used in structural design of hot-stamped automotive parts and expected to obtain maximum lightweight efficiency while maintaining crash performance by using local patchwork blanks instead of conventional reinforcement. Firstly, the technical feasibility of this technology was verified in an experimental method, and an optimization method was proposed to determine the optimal position and shape of local patchwork blanks. Then it was used for the improvements of two parts as examples, a top-hat channel created based on a conventional B pillar cross section and a B pillar. Finite element (FE) analysis models of these two parts were established based on the deformation of B pillar during full vehicle side impact and validated through experiments. It was confirmed that both the top-hat channel and the B pillar optimized have the same crashworthiness but became lighter compared to the original parts with reinforcement. Furthermore, the effects of local patchwork blank thickness, material strength and outer thickness on the optimal position and shape of local patchwork blanks and lightweight efficiency were investigated. Finally, the effectiveness of a hot-stamped B pillar with local patchwork blanks was verified through full vehicle side impact simulations. It can be concluded that the established local patchwork hot stamping technology and the proposed optimization method can be used as a dependable tool to design and manufacture hot-stamped parts with local patchwork blanks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  Title = {Effect of Window and Hole Pattern Cut-Outs on Design Optimization of 3D
   Printed Braces},
  Journal = {FRONTIERS IN REHABILITATION SCIENCES},
  Year = {2022},
  Volume = {3},
  Month = {JUN 24},
  Abstract = {BackgroundThere are many different Thoracic Lumbar Sacral Orthosis style brace designs available in the market for the correction of scoliosis deformity. Hole cut out patterns, are commonly used in brace designs. These cut-outs may be subdivided into two groups: hole patterns and windows. Hole patterns are an array of holes which are implemented to lighten the weight of a brace and allow for the skin to breathe. Windows provide space for spinal derotation and/or breathing. From an examination of the literature, it appears that a systematic analysis of the effect of these cut-outs on the structural integrity and functionality of the brace has not been undertaken. Furthermore, there is a lack of understanding on the effect of spacing, size and geometry of the cut-outs on the mechanical behavior of the brace. Method of ApproachIn this study, Finite Element Analysis is employed to examine the mechanical response of the brace to these cut-outs. Geometry for the Thoracic Lumbar Sacral Orthosis was obtained by scanning an existing brace using an optical scan and converted into a Computer Aided Design model. A systematic approach was undertaken where cut-out geometry, spacing and size was varied. The deformation and stress in the thickness of the brace was ascertained from the Finite Element Analysis. An appropriate factor of safety for the structural analysis was determined using a standardized approach and used to quantify the structural integrity of the brace due to the cut-out. Various geometries were analyzed for the hole patterns including circle, triangle, diamond, and hexagon. For the window, the geometries considered were circle, trapezoidal and the ``bib{''} geometry. ResultsIt was found that linear hole patterns where the holes are aligned do not provide a desirable structural factor safety. Furthermore, among all the possible geometries, the hexagonal cut-out was the best structurally while reducing the weight of the brace the most. The optimal spacing was found to be 12 mm, and the optimal hole surface area was found to be 78.54 mm(2). For the windows in the abdominal area, the ``bib{''} shape provided the best structural integrity and generated the lowest amount of deformation. An increase in the size of this window had a small effect on the stress but an almost negligible effect on the deformation. ConclusionsA hexagonal hole pattern should be used with a spacing of 12 mm and each hole should have a surface area of 78.54 mm(2). Windows in the abdominal area should be of ``bib{''} shape. The size of the window cut-outs does not affect the brace stress and deformation significantly. Thus, the size of these windows should be based on the functional aspects of the brace, i.e., the minimum required size needed to permit the patient to breathe comfortably as in the case of the abdominal window or to allow for proper derotation, as in the case of the derotation window.},

However, only few bridges supported by concrete shells have been designed and built after the Musmeci’s bridge in Potenza (Italy). Several numerical form-finding methods have been implemented in the last decades to optimize the shape of shells. In the present paper, a comparison of the Thrust Network Analysis (TNA) and Particle-Spring System (PS) is made by searching the optimal shape of a concrete shell supporting the curved cantilevered deck of a pedestrian bridge under the same boundary conditions. Finite Element Analysis was performed to compare the structural behaviour of the footbridges optimized by the two different form-finding techniques. The effectiveness of both form-finding methods in minimizing unfavourable tensile stresses in concrete shells, thus taking advantage of mechanical properties of concrete, is investigated. Furthermore, transverse deflections of the curved cantilevered deck were reduced introducing an external prestressing system applied to the upper flange of the ring box girder.

  abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Topology optimization has been proved to be an efficient tool for structural design. In recent years, the focus of structural topology optimization has been shifting from single material continuum structures to multimaterial and multiscale structures. This paper aims at devising a numerical scheme for designing bionic structures by combining a two-stage parametric level set topology optimization with the conformal mapping method. At the first stage, the macro-structural topology and the effective material properties are optimized simultaneously. At the second stage, another structural topology optimization is carried out to identify the exact layout of the metamaterial at the mesoscale. The achieved structure and metamaterial designs are further synthesized to form a multiscale structure using conformal mapping, which mimics the bionic structures with "orderly chaos"features. In this research, a multi-control-point conformal mapping (MCM) based on Ricci flow is proposed. Compared with conventional conformal mapping with only four control points, the proposed MCM scheme can provide more flexibility and adaptivity in handling complex geometries. To make the effective mechanical properties of the metamaterials invariant after conformal mapping, a variable-thickness structure method is proposed. Three 2D numerical examples using MCM schemes are presented, and their results and performances are compared. The achieved multimaterial multiscale structure models are characterized by the "orderly chaos"features of bionic structures while possessing the desired performance.<br/></div> Copyright © 2020 by ASME.},

  abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">In this dissertation, conjugate stress (CS) sensing is advanced through a parametric evaluation of a surface-mounted design and through experimental validation in monotonic and cyclic tensile tests. The CS sensing concept uses a pair of sensors of significantly different mechanical stiffness for direct query of the instantaneous local stress-strain relationship in the host structure, thus offering measurement of important health indicators such as stiffness (modulus), yield strength, strain hardening, and cyclic hysteresis. In this study, surface-mounted CS sensor designs are parametrically evaluated with finite element modeling, with respect to the sensors’ location, thickness, and modulus and the external loading state. An analytic pin-force model is developed to infer the host structure’s stress-strain state, based on the strain outputs of the CS sensor-pair. Two CS sensor designs are fabricated – one employs resistive foil strain gauges and the second employs fiber optic sensors – and paired with the pin-force model for experimental demonstration of the measurement of: (i) stress-strain history of three different isotropic metal bars (aluminum, copper, and steel) as they experience monotonic tensile loads well into plasticity and (ii) stress-strain hysteresis of a steel bar as it is subject to cyclic tensile fatigue. In the cyclic tests, two machine learning algorithms – anomaly detection and neural net classification – are used in conjunction with the estimated host stiffness from the CS sensor and pin force model to predict the onset of damage in the steel beams.

The proposed approach is particularly suitable for the conceptual phase of the design process, as it allows generating a wide range of design options of discrete air-supported structures without membrane material in real-time while taking into account the overall mechanical behaviour and the architectural potentials of these structures. Benchmarking analysis is carried out using Finite Element Method (FEM) models without the membrane material to validate the feasibility of the discrete structures generated using the proposed form-finding approach. The comparison between the models created by means of the proposed approach and the FEM models shows general compatibility in terms of the geometry of the structures and distribution of the internal forces. Moreover, a complete design method for air-supported structures that combines the strengths of vector-based 3D graphic statics and CEM, for the conceptual phase, and FEM, for the advanced phase with models that include the membrane material, is discussed.<br/> © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {The purpose of an automotive chassis is to maintain the shape of the vehicle and bear the various loads that are applied to the vehicle. The structure typically accounts for a large portion of the development and production costs of the new vehicle program, and the designer has many different structural concepts available. Choosing the best is important to ensure acceptable structural performance under other design constraints, such as cost, volume and method of production, product application, and more. The material selection for chassis depends upon various factors like lightness, economy, safety, recyclability, and circulation of life. The current study aims to perform optimization of the design of a heavy vehicle chassis using central composite design & optimal space fill design scheme (s) with the material tested is Al6092/SiC/17.5p MMC. Different design points are generated using design of experiments. The equivalent stress, deformation and mass are evaluated for each design points. The CAD modelling and FE simulation of heavy motor vehicle chassis is conducted using ANSYS software. From the optimization conducted on chassis design, response surface plots of equivalent stress, deformation and mass are generated which enabled to determine the range of dimensions for which these parameters are maximum or minimum. The use of Discontinuously Reinforced Aluminium-Matrix Composites Al6092/SiC/17.5p MMC aided to reduce weight of chassis by 66.25% and 66.68% by using CCD and Optimal space fill design scheme respectively, without much reduction in strength of chassis. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Triangular, square and pentagonal tree-liked fractal structures are developed, and their mechanical behaviors and deformation processes are conducted by quasi-static axial crushing testing. The theoretical model of the tree-liked fractal structure is introduced to analyze their energy absorption under quasi-static and dynamic loads. Then, the numerical comparative study of the tree-liked fractal structure on crushing characteristics is further carried out based on high accuracy finite element model. The tree-liked fractal structure has great potential to improve specific energy absorption and crash force efficiency compared with the single-walled structure, and the 3rd order tree-liked fractal structure exhibits the best carrying capacity. In addition, the parametric design is adopted to obtain an optimal fractal coefficient and the optimal distribution of the wall thickness of the 3rd order tree-like fractal structure. Furthermore, the crashworthiness comparison of 3rd order tree-like fractal structure and typical multi-cell structures with the same mass is performed to reveal the advantage for the energy absorption.

  abstract = {Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite bridges are usually constructed for rapid installation. The durability of the bridge is increased by stiffness, strength to weight ratio, and corrosion resistance. The main factors on which the design of the composite sandwiched bridge considerably depends are ply layers, material system, alignment of ply angles, and thickness of the core. In this work, a parametric design study for a bridge using finite element analysis (FEA) is presented. Two types of composite materials—carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP)—were used as the sandwich structure’s skin, and three different types of woods were used as a core. Different design configurations were acquired based on material and instability constraints by using Euro-codes. Failure criterion of Tsai-Hill, Tsai-Wu, MS, equivalent stress, and maximum shear stress were implemented to analyze the overall failure of the bridge deck under Ultimate Limit State (ULS) conditions. The total deformation was examined under Serviceability Limit State (SLS) conditions, and the results were compared and verified by the previous study. The core was also examined using the core-factor and increasing the thickness of the core through parametric modeling. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  Abstract = {In order to assess the performance of a vehicle in the conceptual design stage, a square box model was proposed to predict the torsional stiffness and the first-order torsional frequency of Body-in-White. The structure of Body-in-White was decomposed into eight simple structural surfaces, from which a square box model was constructed. Based on the finite element method, modified shear stiffness of each simple structure surface was calculated and the torsional stiffness was obtained. Then, simple structural surfaces of Body-in-White were constructed into an eight degree-of-freedom series spring system to calculate the first-order torsional frequency. Furthermore, a multiobjective genetic algorithm was used to determine the thickness and structural reinforcement of panels with small stiffness, so as to achieve the goal of increasing the stiffness while reducing the mass of the panel. The result shows that the optimal values of thickness are reduced by around 9.9 percent without affecting their performance by the proposed method. Compared to the prediction results obtained with the complicated numerical simulation, the relative error of the square box model in predicting the torsional stiffness is 6.04 percent and in predicting the first-order torsional frequency is 0.95 percent, indicating that the prediction model is effective.},

This system can be applied as temporary or semi-permanent structures. It takes advantage of utilizing parametric design and prefabrication in order to optimize its structural and sustainable characteristics. &Scy;BA-CFS (complex bending-active continuous flexible sheet) structures are made with flexible materials and based on the interaction of bent and tensioned elements in balance, complementing one another. The main element of the structure is a bending-active surface, bent bidirectionally in a complex buckled geometry to realize double curvature. The orientation and size of the buckles take into consideration the specific rules of the form-finding and its stress distribution. The innovation behind the proposal lays in a new comprehension of the concept of a bending-active surface, avoiding tessellation or cuts. The bent shape is kept static through a set of membranes working in tension. The proposed pavilion project is made-up of a unique knitted architectural material, inspired by spacer fabrics. This specific material proposal strongly supports the concept of uniform non-tessellated bending-active sheet, adapted to a wide range of forms with a single homogeneous piece. A sample of the material is produced manually at a 1:1 scale and a model of pavilion at 1:5 scale.

  abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">The thesis explores methods for integration of structural analysis, design and production in a digital design environment. The somewhat ambiguous title implies the ambition to make such integration in relation to the explorative phase of the design process which is described by Donald Schon as having a conversational character. A conversation between the designer and the representation by the means of the tool. The tool is in this context a simulation and instead of exploring the potential of automatic optimisation, the simulation is used for designer driven exploration.The aim of the thesis is to give an overview of how this type of integration is currently being approached and to contribute with new tools and methods in that pursuit. The motivation behind the work is to lower the threshold for the application of structural analysis in early-stage design, with an ambition of architectural qualities and resource efficiency in mind.An overview of the historical context is portrayed with broad brush strokes, followed by a more precise account of the mathematical and physical context, which is complemented by an attempt to describe how our tools and roles tend to interplay in the composition of the design process. Methods such as the finite element method, isogeometric analysis, smoothed particle hydrodynamics and peridynamics, including their related geometrical representations are introduced in relation to this context. A variety of production techniques are also discussed in relation to material mechanical properties for conventional building materials such as steel, concrete and wood.The method development is approached through the use of numerical and physical experiments which are applied for design of material-efficient structural components, with a particular design process perspective. The nodal connection is chosen as an application because it combines geometrical and structural complexity in an element that is of crucial importance for a holistic spatial setting, while often being produced in a material inefficient way, with poor attention to detail.The three articles that are included follow a trajectory from large to small, from the holistic to the particular. The first article is a description of the computational design work with the roof for the new international airport of Mexico City. The second article aims to address one of the challenges that were faced in that project with material inefficiency for nodal connections, with a critical perspective on optimisation. The final article presents an extension/modification for the peridynamics theory enabling variable particle sizes and an irregular particle distribution through the introduction of a concept called force flux density. The development is motivated by limitations found in the present theory through numerical experiments. The method enables simulation of phenomena such as brittle fracture, for which correlation with Griffith's theory of fracture is shown.Further work includes an extension of the force flux method from 2D to 3D, including calibration of material a model for 3D printed steel. Other possibilities involve the exploration of how such a method can adapt to the various stages of the design process, where requirements of accuracy, speed and interactivity will vary.

  abstract = {To predict the vibroacoustic performance of complex thin-walled structures, an analysis using a finite element model considering structure–acoustic interaction is often required. The acoustic response of such models can be time-consuming to compute and sensitive to minor design changes. These models can be too computationally intense since fast design optimizations must be performed. Moreover, knowledge of the final design is limited in the conceptual design phase, which implies that detailed modeling and analysis is of less value. It is therefore of interest for engineers to evaluate an efficient conceptual model using a prediction metric that has an acceptable correlation to the acoustic response of the structure. In this paper, we investigate different vibroacoustic prediction metrics for their adequacy to be used in the conceptual design of a thin-walled lightweight structure. As a reference model, we use a finite element model considering structure–acoustic interaction to compute the vibroacoustic performance of an automotive vehicle. We evaluate the adequacy of different prediction metrics for a conceptual model in terms of their correlation to the acoustic response inside the vehicle computed using the detailed reference model. Two measures were determined to have poor performance as prediction metrics: frequencies of the fundamental modes and global stiffness, respectively. However, a significant correlation was demonstrated for a prediction metric based on transfer mobilities.<br/> © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Using the capabilities of computation and digital fabrication this thesis provides a basis for a novel process of design to fabrication for reciprocal systems. In the traditional sense, reciprocal structures combine the advantages of timber as a renewable source of construction material and low-energy production with the modular fabrication, fabrication efficiency, structural capacities, and elegance of reciprocal interconnection of members. The unique benefits of reciprocal systems come from their discrete geometry, which simplifies the connection detailing and provides freedom for local and global variations in the system. However, this reduction in construction complexity and flexibility of local variation is replaced with geometrical complexity due to numerous compatibility constraints coupled with the structural behavior of the system. This research therefore identifies the key design parameters and design constraints of reciprocal systems. The results demonstrate the complex coupling of geometry, structural performance and fabrication in these systems, hence an essential need for application of an integrative design process. Through the application of computation, simulation, and digital fabrication this research proposes an integrative computational design process which can effectively address the coupling of design, analysis and fabrication of reciprocal systems and accommodate design exploration and optimization.First, a novel computational method for geometric modelling and form-finding is presented to resolve the compatibility constraints and generate the essential geometric and topological data for analysis and fabrication. Second, a flexible and scalable analysis method is implemented to study the interplay of the design parameters and the structural behavior of reciprocal systems. A comprehensive parametric study reveals a complex relationship between the geometric parameters and the structural performance and demonstrates the essential need for a real-time performance feedback for optimal design of free-form reciprocal systems. Third, a generalizable and efficient fabrication process is proposed for reciprocal systems with 3-D module geometry using 5-axis CNC machinery. Towards this goal, four different connection types are proposed, and different fabrication parameters are studied through digital and physical prototyping, destructive structural testing, detailed finite element simulation, and fabrication of a scaled structure. The results are summarized as a guideline for selection of the main fabrication parameters including joint detailing and fabrication tolerances. The computational design process is then developed by rethinking and replacing the conventional direct incremental development by a modular integrative computational process using multi-directional dataflow between different design phases. Finally, the proposed framework is used for a full-scale design to fabrication case study to validate the applicability of the proposed design process.

  abstract = {The demand for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is increasing by day by day due to its wide applications in diverse sectors, ranging from commercial applications to military and disaster relief missions. This paper deals with the design optimization and fabrication of the wing, which has a vital role in the lift generation. The design methodology involves a multidisciplinary system engineering approach towards the selection of pertinent factors. Wing design begins with the conceptual design and configuration selection, wherein the measurements of the wing are deduced. Balsa wood, Birch wood and aluminium were selected for the wing fabrication. A live I/O MATLAB script was utilized to calculate the dimensions of the web, flange, and related load-bearing members. The code also checks for the failure of the spar’s web under shear buckling and optimizes the thickness of the web accordingly. For a better understanding of the behaviour of materials and their response to various loads, Finite Element Analysis was done on Ansys Static Structural software. Eventually, the fabrication of the designed wing was carried out with the aid of CNC router cut and the constituent parts were assembled. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">This work introduces a cluster-based structural optimization (CBSO) method for the design of categorical multimaterial structures subjected to crushing, dynamic loading. The proposed method consists of three steps: conceptual design generation, design clustering, and Bayesian optimization. In the first step, a conceptual design is generated using the hybrid cellular automaton (HCA) algorithm. In the second step, threshold-based cluster analysis yields a lower-dimensional design. Here, a cluster validity index for structural optimization is introduced in order to qualitatively evaluate the clustered design. In the third step, the optimal design is obtained through Bayesian optimization, minimizing a constrained expected improvement function. This function allows to impose soft constraints by properly redefining the expected improvement based on the maximum constraint violation. The Bayesian optimization algorithm implemented in this work has the ability to search over (i) a real design space for sizing optimization, (ii) a categorical design space for material selection, or (iii) a mixed design space for concurrent sizing optimization and material selection. With the proposed method, materials are optimally selected based on multiple attributes and multiple objectives without the need for material ranking. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated with the design for crashworthiness of multimaterial plates and thin-walled structures.<br/></div> Copyright © 2019 by ASME.},

This 300m long bridge can be considered as a unique representative example of pioneering research on the design and construction of optimized structures. First, the design process employed for determining the form of the shell and the relevant constructive issues are described. A refined 3D geometric model of the shell is then obtained through an aerial survey carried out by a commercial UAV and a photogrammetric image-based reconstruction. A recent formulation of the Force Density Method allowing for non-isotropic stress state is exploited to numerically derive the form of the supporting shell; it is validated versus the surveyed geometry of the shell by employing a nonlinear optimization procedure in order to identify forces and stresses to be used as input parameters. Finally, the derived form of the shell is tested by a Finite Element analysis to verify its funicular efficiency, i.e., whether it is capable to withstand design loads by pure membrane actions.<br/> © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {While transformable structures allow rapid assembly, reuse and reconfiguration, their technical complexity and related production or cost issues often hinder architectural application. Yet, vernacular or nomadic structures, like teepees or yurts, show how reversibility and transportability can be achieved with low-tech structural systems. The project presented in this paper is part of a broader research that investigates how material understanding and manipulation through elastic deformation can contribute to the development of low-tech and rapidly assembled kit-of-parts structures. More specifically, the ReciPlyDome project combines the concepts of bendingactive and reciprocal structures. The parametric design and modelling of the system are based on regular polyhedra to guarantee uniformity and allow reconfiguration of the components. While this works from a design perspective, the structural performance is limited by the flexibility of the components. Therefore, we developed a double-layered component to increase the structural height and improve the stiffness of the structure. Preliminary FEM analyses provide assessment of this layering and stress stiffening, i.e. the stiffening effect of the residual stress. A full-scale prototype illustrates the rapid and low-tech manufacturing and assembly process. Through design, analysis and finally construction, this project illustrates the potential of active-bending in developing more low-tech and rapidly assembled structures. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The aim of the study is to develop an original, methodical, and practical approach to the early stages of parametric design of roof shells formed by repetitive modules of Catalan surfaces. It is presented on the example of designing the roof shells compound of four concrete elements. The designing process proposed by us consists in linking geometric shaping of roofs' models with their structural analysis and optimization. Contrary to other methods, which use optimization process in order to find free roof forms, we apply it in order to explore and improve design alternatives. It is realized with the application of designing tools working in Rhinoceros 3D software. The flexible scripts elaborated by us, in order to achieve roofs' models of regular and symmetrical shapes, are converted into simulation models to perform structural analysis. It is mainly focused on how the roof shells perform dependently on their geometric characteristics. The simulation enables one to evaluate various roof shells' shapes, as well as to select an optimal design solution. The proposed approach to the conceptual design process may drive the designing to achieve geometric and structural forms which not only follow the design intentions but also target better results. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Screw and plate fixation is commonly used to treat bone fractures. A prototype application (APP) for presurgical simulation was developed and validated by comparing it with current analytical approach and other models. In this APP, alternative plate designs and materials to limit the effects of stress shielding could be tested. In addition, the number and position of screws and the gap between bone and plate that achieved acceptable stability were predicted. The fixation stability providing a situation of interfragmentary strain between 2% and 10% is necessary for callus formation. However, improving the fixation stability leads to a stress shielding effect. The simultaneous alleviation of stress shielding and maintenance of stability are important in fracture healing. In this study, the feasibility of creating a specialized APP to evaluate different screw-plate configurations for diaphyseal femoral fractures was investigated. The ultimate goal is to extend this technique to computer-assisted preoperative planning for orthopedic surgery. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In order to use structural optimization methods to find the geometry that gives the best possible performance, both the geometry and the effect of the production process on the local material behaviour thus has to be considered. In this work, a multidisciplinary methodology to consider local microstructure-based material behaviour in optimizations of the design of engineering structures is presented. By adopting a knowledge-based industrial product realisation perspective combined with a previously presented simulation strategy for microstructure-based material behaviour in Finite Element Analyses (FEA), the methodology integrates Computer Aided Design (CAD), casting and injection moulding simulations, FEA, design automation and a multi-objective optimization scheme into a novel structural optimization method for cast metal and injection moulded polymeric parts. The different concepts and modules in the methodology are described, their implementation into a prototype software is outlined, and the application and relevance of the methodology is discussed.<br/> © 2017},

  Abstract = {Multidisciplinary design optimization has become a powerful technique to facilitate continuous improvement of complex and multidisciplinary products. Parametric modeling is an essential part with tremendous impact on the flexibility and robustness of multidisciplinary design optimization. This article investigates the effect of relational and non-relational parameterization techniques on the robustness and flexibility of the conceptual design of a multidisciplinary product. Bench marking between relational and non-relational parameterization and their effect on flexibility and robustness indicate that the relational parameterization is an efficient method in the multidisciplinary design optimization process. The inherent properties of the method contribute to an efficient parametric modeling with improved communication between different disciplines. This enhances the performance of the multidisciplinary design optimization process and allows a more flexible and robust design. The considered disciplines are computer-aided design, computational fluid dynamics, finite element analysis, and dynamic simulation. A high-fidelity geometry created in a computer-aided design environment is computer-aided design centric approach and later used in computational fluid dynamics, finite element analysis for a better understanding of the product as it leads to precise outcomes. The proposed approach is implemented for the conceptual design of a novel product, a tidal power plant developed by Minesto AB using a multidisciplinary design optimization process.},

  title = {Experimental Study and Finite Element Analysis of Laser Beam Formed Steel for Enhanced Structural Integrity},

  author = {Akinlabi, Stephen Akinwale},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Forming is a flexible manufacturing process by which a variety of different shapes can be produced through mechanical, thermo-mechanical or thermal processes. In particular, laser forming is an innovative technique that employs a defocused laser beam to form sheet metal instead of the conventional approach of using external forces. It is also referred to as the manufacturing process by which the size or shape of a part is changed by the application of forces or heat, or both - thereby inducing stresses in part.There has been a considerable amount of work on laser forming to date. However, due to the presence of a vast number of process variables and the wide variety of materials that can be laser formed, there is a need for an even better understanding of the process. Furthermore, the theoretical, experimental and numerical research to date on laser forming has primarily focused on the investigation of the effect of process parameters on the bending of sheet materials at an angle. To advance the laser forming process further for practical forming applications and to compete with the conventional forming methods, the author has investigated both experimentally and numerically the laser forming of several bend angles, resulting in curved profiles of the sheet metal component. This is currently a gap in the literature and has remained largely unexplored.The work presented in this thesis primarily focuses on the process of laser forming of sheet metal by using a high laser beam power as the heat source. The overall aim being the investigation of structural integrity of the processed material. This work is intended to increase the understanding of the laser forming process and in particular the transient thermo-mechanical response of the material. The results of both the experimental investigations and finite element analysis of the laser formed steel sheet are presented and discussed.The first part of the thesis describes the experimental study of the laser forming of the mild steel sheet. This is achieved through the classical design of experiment based on L-27 Taguchi Orthogonal Array (TOA) concept. The twenty-seven different experiments repeated with three replicates led to an ultimate saving of the time and cost of the experiments, instead of the two hundred and forty-three experiments that would have to be conducted, based on the full factorial approach of experimentation. Also, sets of optimum process parameters for forming the steel sheets were established from the L-27 TOA, which was subsequently employed for fatigue characterization of the laser formed samples.Three optimised setting samples were selected from the L-27 TOA after validating the complete (two hundred and forty-three) generated data through regression analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The above-selected samples were characterised based on the microstructural evaluation, tensile testing, microhardness profiling, residual stress determination, temperature measurements and fatigue testing. Microstructural evaluation of the laser formed optimised nine samples revealed elongated grain structures, which varied indirectly with the amount of applied laser line energy. From the measured grain sizes of the samples formed at the maximum process parameter settings the deformation was found to be maximum in comparison to the laser formed samples at other parameter settings, the parent material and the mechanically formed samples, because the grains had recrystallized. Similarly, it was observed that the residual stresses increase as the line energy increases, which was attributed to the multiple scan irradiations.Also, the temperature distribution across the formed samples was observed to increase as the line energy increases during the laser forming process. Conversely, a progressive increase in the average microhardness and the yield strength was achieved in all the laser formed samples. The resulting properties of the laser formed samples made in this study, could be said to be a measure of their enhanced structural integrity of the formed samples.The second part of the thesis focuses on a nonlinear, transient three-dimensional finite element model, which has been developed for laser forming simulation. The simulations were performed through the couple thermal-structural analysis for a straight line heating. Parametric finite element models are prepared by using ANSYS Parametric Design Language, (APDL) a scripting language, provided by the commercial finite element analysis code ANSYS, Version 14.0. The thermomechanical behaviours during the straight line heating process were presented regarding temperature, displacement and stresses. The finite element simulation results were validated with the experimental results; and found to be in close agreement.Lastly, the experimental and analytical approach both were employed to determine the number of cycles to failure during a fatigue test. The experimental fatigue tests were conducted using a dynamic fatigue machine. This is aimed to determine the effect of the laser forming process on the fatigue properties of the formed samples. The number of cycles to failure of both the parent material and the laser formed samples were established. The fatigue test results indicated that the number of cycles to failure for the laser formed samples reduces in samples formed at low (12.6%), medium (20.2%) and high (43.9%) parameters in comparison to the parent material. This is expected due to the effect of the laser forming and deformation process. For validation, the experimental number of cycles to failure for both the parent material and the laser formed samples were found by the analytical method. The two results were observed to be in good agreement.In conclusion, an overall analysis of the different characterization results showed an improved material and mechanical properties and enhanced fatigue properties in the samples laser formed to different curvatures using the three sets of process parameters. However, the fatigue enhancement observed in the laser formed samples changes on the three sets of process parameters employed, but samples formed with the minimum setting revealed a significant improvement.

  abstract = {The aircraft design process generally comprises three consecutive phases: conceptual, preliminary and detailed design phase. In the conceptual design phase a basis aircraft layout is defined using multidisciplinary analysis procedures. For the structural layout, however, the preliminary design phase is of particular interest as more detailed calculations are introduced to enhance the basic design of the primary structure. Up to date, semi-analytical methods are widely used in this design stage to estimate the structural mass. Although these methods lead to adequate results for the major aircraft components of standard configurations, the evaluation of new configurations (e.g., box wing, blended wing body) or specific structural components with complex loading conditions (e.g., center wing box) is very challenging and demands higher fidelity approaches based on Finite Elements (FE). To accelerate FE model generation in a multidisciplinary design environment, automated processes based on a parametric model description have been introduced. To easily couple in- and output of different tools, a standardized data format—CPACS (Common Parametric Aircraft Configuration Schema)—is used. The versatile structural description in CPACS, the implementation in model generation tools, but also current limitations and future enhancements will be discussed. Recent development on the progress of numerical process chains for structural sizing and crashworthiness applications on solid ground and on water (ditching) are presented in this paper.<br/> © 2016, Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.},

  abstract = {Tensairity girder is a light weight inflatable fabric structural concept which can be used in road emergency transportation. It uses low pressure air to stabilize compression elements against buckling. With the purpose of obtaining the comprehensive target of minimum deflection and weight under ultimate load, the cross-section and the inner pressure of tensairity girder was optimized in this paper. The Variable Complexity Modeling (VCM) method was used in this paper combining the Kriging approximate method with the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) method, which was implemented by ABAQUS. In the Kriging method, the sample points of the surrogate model were outlined by Design of Experiment (DOE) technique based on Optimal Latin Hypercube. The optimization framework was constructed in iSIGHT with a global optimization method, Multi-Island Genetic Algorithm (MIGA), followed by a local optimization method, Sequential Quadratic Program (SQP). The result of the optimization gives a prominent conceptual design of the tensairity girder, which approves the solution architecture of VCM is feasible and efficient. Furthermore, a useful trend of sensitivity between optimization variables and responses was performed to guide future design. It was proved that the inner pressure is the key parameter to balance the maximum Von Mises stress and deflection on tensairity girder, and the parameters of cross section impact the mass of tensairity girder obviously.<br/> © The Korean Society for Aeronautical & Space Sciences.},

For biomechanical functions where mechanical qualities are required from supporting under external loading and permeability is crucial which affects bone tissue engineering, the geometric design in lattice structure for bone scaffolds in loading-bearing applications is necessary. However, when tweaking structural traits, these two factors frequently clash. For graded lattice structures, this study aims to develop a design-optimization strategy to attain improved attributes across different domains. Design/methodology/approach: To handle diverse stress states, parametric modeling is used to produce strut-based lattice structures with spatially varied densities. The tailored initial gradients in lattice structure are subject to automatic property evaluation procedure that hinges on finite element method and computational fluid dynamics simulations. The geometric parameters of lattice structures with numerous objectives are then optimized using an iterative optimization process based on a non-dominated genetic algorithm. Findings: The initial stress-based design of graded lattice structure with spatially variable densities is generated based on the stress conditions. The results from subsequent dual-objective optimization show a series of topologies with gradually improved trade-offs between mechanical properties and permeability. Originality/value: In this study, a novel structural design-optimization methodology is proposed for mathematically optimizing strut-based graded lattice structures to achieve enhanced performance in multiple domains.<br/></div> © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract = {Minimum weight, Long fatigue life and adequate film thickness are some of the key design objectives in the optimum design of rolling element bearing (REB). The design approach by considering bearing envelop, fatigue life and wear life results in a low cost bearing. So a multi-objective constrained optimum design of deep groove ball bearing is proposed in this study. The weight, dynamic load capacity and minimum elasto-hydrodynamic film thickness of bearing are considered as the design objectives with some kinematic constraint. The optimum design has been solved by implementing a hybrid particle swarm optimization and teaching learning based optimization algorithm due to its convergence capability. A statistical test was performed to test the superiority of the proposed algorithm. The convergence study identifies the critical design variables. A constraint conformation study has been performed to investigate the relative importance of the constraints. In order to comprehend the changes in objective functions a response analysis is performed on the critical design variables. In addition, the optimum design variables obtained through the design optimization of the bearing are used for preparation of a CAD model. Then the stress analysis using the finite element method is performed on the bearing to identify the critical stress region in the optimized bearing.The validation of this optimum design of the rolling element bearing is performed by developing a prototype with a 3D printer (using rapid prototyping). An approach for simulation model updates and the interactive design is also suggested in this study.<br/> © 2018, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.},

Design recommendations from the LLM are validated using a finite-element solver (FFE Plus solver), forming the core workflow of the proposed approach. To assess its effectiveness, the LLM’s performance is compared against traditional regression-based surrogate models, which serve as baseline references. A two-hole hanger bracket serves as the case study, evaluating prediction accuracy, data efficiency, generalization capability, and workflow complexity across three materials: 6061-T6, AISI 304, and AISI 1020. The key evaluation indicators include safety factor (SF) and Mass. The results show that the regression models offer high accuracy and interpretability but require extensive amounts of simulation data; in this study, each material required 252 samples to adequately cover the design space. In contrast, GPT-4o produced feasible design suggestions using only 18 initial samples, combining semantic prompting and finite-element analysis. Its prediction accuracy improved significantly with a small number of iterations, demonstrating superior data efficiency and cross-material adaptability. Overall, the findings suggest that, when paired with appropriate prompting strategies and validation mechanisms, LLMs hold great promise as an assistive tool in early-stage structural design optimization.<br/> © 2025 by the authors.},

This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the numerical and experimental assessment of residual stresses caused by welding nozzles to the header. The diameter and wall thickness of the nozzle as well as the diameter of the header are the same in all considered cases, while the wall thickness of the header wall is varied. Three specimens were investigated. The research aims to provide a deeper understanding of the influence of header wall thickness to the residual stresses caused by welding. The Finite Element Method was used to model the heat input during welding and evaluate the residual stresses and deformations. The main focus is on the residual stresses. The numerical models are validated against experimental measurements using semi-destructive measurement method: Incremental Hole Drilling Method according to ASTM E837. The data obtained from experiments are compared with the numerical simulations, leading to a comprehensive assessment of the model's accuracy and predictive capabilities. A very good correlation between both, experimental and numerical approach was obtained. In particular, the study demonstrates that increasing the wall thickness of the header leads to higher residual stresses near the weld, which is crucial information for design engineers aiming to balance mechanical strength with stress control. The validated numerical approach also provides a reliable tool for early-stage design optimization, enabling engineers to simulate and refine welding strategies before actual fabrication. The combination of experimental and numerical approaches provides a holistic view of residual stress evaluation and its applications across various industries, specific in this paper, in the boiler industry, where the equipment operates under pressure and elevated temperatures and weld residual stresses should not be neglected as usual.<br/></div> © 2025, Strojarski Facultet.

  abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Purpose: Gas metal arc-based directed energy deposition (GMA-DED) process experiences residual stress (RS) developed due to heat accumulation during successive layer deposition as a significant challenge. To address that, monitoring of transient temperature distribution concerning time is a critical input. Finite element analysis (FEA) is considered a decisive engineering tool in quantifying temperature and RS in all manufacturing processes. However, computational time and prediction accuracy has always been a matter of concern for FEA-based prediction of responses in the GMA-DED process. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of finite element mesh variations on the developed RS in the GMA-DED process. Design/methodology/approach: The variation in the element shape functions, i.e. linear- and quadratic-interpolation elements, has been used to model a single-track 10-layered thin-walled component in Ansys parametric design language. Two cases have been proposed in this study: Case 1 has been meshed with the linear-interpolation elements and Case 2 has been meshed with the combination of linear- and quadratic-interpolation elements. Furthermore, the modelled responses are authenticated with the experimental results measured through the data acquisition system for temperature and RS. Findings: A good agreement of temperature and RS profile has been observed between predicted and experimental values. Considering similar parameters, Case 1 produced an average error of 4.13%, whereas Case 2 produced an average error of 23.45% in temperature prediction. Besides, comparing the longitudinal stress in the transverse direction for Cases 1 and 2 produced an error of 8.282% and 12.796%, respectively. Originality/value: To avoid the costly and time-taking experimental approach, the experts have suggested the utilization of numerical methods in the design optimization of engineering problems. The FEA approach, however, is a subtle tool, still, it faces high computational cost and low accuracy based on the choice of selected element technology. This research can serve as a basis for the choice of element technology which can predict better responses in the thermo-mechanical modelling of the GMA-DED process.<br/></div> © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract = {Of interest in this paper is the description of damage evolution in anisotropic materials where it is mainly observed that damage is in general strongly influenced by the anisotropy itself. More specifically, transversely isotropic materials such as unidirectional fibre-reinforced composites and sedimentary rocks are under focus. The approach we use is based on continuum damage mechanics where the damage gradient quantity is involved. In this work, this latter is oriented toward privileged directions where damage will most probably propagate. This task is accomplished by adopting the integrity-basis formulation where the directional damage gradient is embedded and, otherwise, allows for a neat decomposition of the material response into directional, transverse, and pure shear contributions. This offers an appealing framework where damage characterization can be easily formulated. Damage can be chosen to be governed by transverse strains, by in-plane pure shear strains, or by both of them. One can then speak, respectively, of a mode-I, mode-II, or mixed I/II damage mechanisms if use is made of the terminology adopted in fracture mechanics. On the numerical side, an algorithmic design is proposed for an easy implementation within the context of the finite element method. A set of numerical examples is then presented to explore qualitatively the potential of the proposed framework.<br/> © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

All tiles can be prefabricated in the shop with an adaptable and reusable molding system. Once the assembly is completed, the tiles are post-tensioned through a network of cables to minimize tension and avoid detachment. The top surface can finally be completed with an in situ cast layer that fills the gaps and activates the entire shell behavior. In contrast, the bottom surface maintains a jagged aesthetics. The paper presents the automatic pipeline supporting the computational design of these shells, from an input shape to its fabrication. The segmentation of the input shape is guided by a field-aligned quad mesh derived from the principal stresses of the thin shell. The tiles are flattened individually and extruded along the normal of the best-fitting plane. In this configuration, only edge midpoints of adjacent tiles share a contact point. Thus, forces can mainly flow along the tiles’ cross directions. The best configuration of cable paths and pre-loads is found by solving a constrained optimization problem exploiting a reduced model of the shell as a network of beams. Six different input shapes are tested to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed design method. The working hypotheses are validated through a higher-resolution nonlinear Finite Element Analysis. The fabrication pipeline is assessed utilizing a reduced-scale 3D-printed replica.<br/></div> © 2024 Institution of Structural Engineers},

  abstract = {Offshore wind turbines (OWTs) are dynamically loaded structures and therefore the estimation of the natural frequency is an important design calculation to avoid resonance and resonance related effects (such as fatigue). Monopiles are currently the most used foundation type and are also being considered in deeper waters (>30 m) where a stiff transition piece will join the monopile and the tapered tall tower. While rather computationally expensive, high fidelity finite element analysis can be carried to find the Eigen solutions of the whole system considering soil-structure interaction; a quick hand calculation method is often convenient during the design optimisation stage or conceptual design stage. This paper proposes a simplified methodology to obtain the first natural frequency of the whole system using only limited data on the WTG (Wind Turbine Generator), tower dimensions, monopile dimensions and the ground. The most uncertain component is the ground and is characterised by two parameters: type of ground profile (i.e. soil stiffness variation with depth) and the soil stiffness at one monopile depth below mudline. In this framework, the fixed base natural frequency of the wind turbine is first calculated and is then multiplied by two non-dimensional factors to account for the foundation flexibility (i.e. the effect of soil-structure interaction). The theoretical background behind the model is the Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories where the foundation is idealised by three coupled springs (lateral, rocking and cross-coupling). 10 wind turbines founded in different ground conditions from 10 different wind farms in Europe (e.g. Walney, Gunfleet sand, Burbo Bank, Belwind, Barrow, Kentish flat, Blyth, Lely, Thanet Sand, Irene Vorrink) have been analysed and the results compared with the measured natural frequencies. The results show good accuracy (errors below 3.5%). A step by step sample calculation is also shown for practical use of the proposed methodology. Abstract Copyright (2016) Elsevier, B.V.},

To address this challenge, this paper aims to introduce underwater transducer parametric simulation (UTPS) software to streamline the design and optimization process. Design/methodology/approach: The design methodology integrates the strengths of ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL) for parametric design with the Qt Creator framework for developing a visual interface. C++ is used to encapsulate complex, hard-to-master APDL macros and interact with ANSYS software to execute the relevant APDL macros, performing finite element analysis on the underwater transducer in the background. The results are then processed and displayed on the visual interface. Findings: UTPS enables parametric modeling, modal analysis, harmonic response analysis and directivity analysis of underwater transducers. Users only need to input parameters into the software interface to obtain the transducer’s performance, significantly improving work efficiency and lowering the professional threshold. A prototype transducer was fabricated and tested based on UTPS results, which confirmed the accuracy of the software. Originality/value: This paper presents an innovative parametric simulation tool for underwater transducers, combining finite element analysis and APDL to simplify and expedite the design process. UTPS reduces the need for specialized knowledge, cutting down on training costs, while its parametric design capabilities accelerate the design process, saving resources.<br/></div> © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In such a manner, an efficient approach for the MBDO-driven design of TO-based concepts is obtained. An implicit hypersurface representing the TO-based concept is generated by classifying the TO-solutions of zeros and ones by using the 1-norm SVM of Mangasarian. The implicit SVM-based hypersurfaces are then utilized to set up designs of experiments of nonlinear finite element analyses by morphing the TO-based concepts by using Boolean and blending operations. Finally, MBDO is performed by using an ensemble of metamodels consisting of quadratic regression, Kriging, radial basis function networks, polynomial chaos expansion and support vector regression models. The proposed MBDO framework is demonstrated by minimizing the mass of a three-dimensional design domain with a constraint on the plastic limit load. The performance of the approach is most promising.<br/> © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

  abstract = {Background and objective: Spinal degeneration and instability are commonly treated with interbody fusion cages either alone or supplemented with posterior instrumentation with the aim to immobilise the segment and restore intervertebral height. The purpose of this work is to establish a tool which may help to understand the effects of intervertebral cage design and placement on the biomechanical response of a patient-specific model to help reducing post-surgical complications such as subsidence and segment instability. Methods: A 3D lumbar functional spinal unit (FSU) finite element model was created and a parametric model of an interbody cage was designed and introduced in the FSU. A Drucker–Prager Cap plasticity formulation was used to predict plastic strains and bone failure in the vertebrae. The effect of varying cage size, cross-sectional area, apparent stiffness and positioning was evaluated under 500 N preload followed by 7.5 Nm multidirectional rotation and the results were compared with the intact model. Results: The most influential cage parameters on the FSU were size, curvature congruence with the endplates and cage placement. Segmental stiffness was higher when increasing the cross-sectional cage area in all loading directions and when the cage was anteriorly placed in all directions but extension. In general, the facet joint forces were reduced by increasing segmental stiffness. However, these forces were higher than in the intact model in most of the cases due to the displacement of the instantaneous centre of rotation. The highest plastic deformations took place at the caudal vertebra under flexion and increased for cages with greater stiffness. Thus, wider cages and a more anteriorly placement would increase the volume of failed bone and, therefore, the risk of subsidence. Conclusions: Cage geometry plays a crucial role in the success of lumbar surgery. General considerations such as larger cages may be applied as a guideline, but parameters such as curvature or cage placement should be determined for each specific patient. This model provides a proof-of-concept of a tool for the preoperative evaluation of lumbar surgical outcomes.<br/> © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Random vibration loads are one of the important causes of electronic device failure, and it is necessary to conduct vibration reliability analysis on the circuit boards and their leads that are prone to failure. In this paper, a finite element model of the printed circuit board (PCB) with plastic quad flat package (PQFP) is established, to investigate the reliability design of the PCB under random vibration load. The modal analysis of the circuit board is conducted using the digital image correlation (DIC) technology combined with the force hammer method, which is a non-contact measurement method, to verify the validity of the simulation model and avoid the additional mass caused by contact measurement. Based on the verified model, the optimal parameter configuration of PCB thickness (H1), package thickness (H2), lead width (w), thickness (t), length (l) and foot angle (θ) is obtained by using Taguchi orthogonal method. After the collaborative optimization of the structural parameters of the PCBA, the maximum equivalent stress value of the leads decreased by 33.54 %. Based on the response surface method, a nonlinear mapping relationship between the lead stress and the component placement was established with the offset in the X and Y directions as variables. The response surface results show that the lead stress varies non-monotonically with the component offset, and there exists an optimal placement of the component with the minimum lead stress. Moreover, the maximum stress value of the component leads is highly sensitive to the combined effect of the X and Y offset. The optimal offset from the center position reduces the lead stress by 72 %. In addition, the circuit boards before and after optimization are compared under different random vibration environments, the results show that the lead stress of the optimized circuit board is 48 % smaller than that of the unoptimized circuit board, verifying the effectiveness of the optimization design. The simultaneous optimization provides a systematic framework for early-stage design optimization, reducing development costs and improving reliability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A significant portion of the environmental impact of a building’s superstructure lies in its structural flooring. By leveraging funicular forms such as thin concrete shells, a materially and carbon-efficient alternative to bending-active flooring systems can be attained. In addition, through segmentation and the use of dry jointed interfaces, a segmented concrete shell allows for ease of disassembly compatible with circular economy principles for the built environment. This paper presents a novel segmented concrete shell flooring system that leverages the symmetry of revolution of the classical fan vault form to facilitate future design flexibility through increased reconfigurability. The design and form-finding of the segmented fan concrete shell are detailed through the use of an evolutionary algorithm and finite element analysis. Quarter-scale prototypes were digitally fabricated using a robotic concrete spraying process which were then assembled and tested to assess its structural potential, evaluate the limitations, and identify areas of future work. An embodied carbon analysis demonstrates that the system provides a mass and embodied carbon saving compared to conventional flooring systems while adding approximately a 20% embodied carbon premium over a comparable non-reconfigurable segmented shell flooring system. Rephrased, the proposed system provides a positive embodied carbon saving if enabling design flexibility through reconfiguration increases the life-span of the system by at least 20%. Through this work, it is shown that a segmented fan concrete shell presents a viable lightweight and carbon-efficient flooring system which has the potential to become a sustainable alternative that enables disassembly, reuse, and even reconfigurability for circular construction provided further research and development to address its current limitations for adoption in industry practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Design/methodology/approach: Additive manufacturing allows making of cost-effective and useable devices with tailored properties for biomedical applications. The endoscopic endonasal approach to the suprasellar area enables the management of different intradural tumours, and the craniectomy at the skull base is generally wide and irregular. Defining an optimal strategy for osteodural defect closure at the preoperative stage represents a significant challenge. Findings: Using the results obtained from a computed tomography analysis, skull base defects were designed to plan the surgical approach. Several concepts of customized buttress models were first built up, initially focusing on thin, flexible edges characterized by different thicknesses. Finite element analyses and design optimization allowed us to achieve the optimal design solution with improved compliance/flexibility for easy intranasal manoeuvrability, maintaining an adequate mechanical stability. As the thickness of the edges decreased, an increase of strain energy values was found (i.e. 1.2 mJ – Model A, 1.7 mJ – Model B, 2.3 mJ – Model C, 4.3 mJ – Model D). However, a further optimization (Model E) led to a significant increase of the compliance (strain energy of 14.1 mJ).

  abstract = {The structural performance of any building design is often dependent on the geometrical shape, which affects its behavior and stability. Structural consideration and optimization in the conceptual stage of the design process can lead to better solutions and design exploration. In this paper, a design approach for generating and structurally optimizing the geometrical form in the conceptual design phase is presented. The method is applied to a canopy of an ecological island (waste collection center in Rome, Italy). We demonstrate how parametric structural design can facilitate the decision-maker to generate and analyze the optimal design solutions rapidly in the conceptual stage of the design process. Fully parametric models are created in a Rhinoceros3D<sup>®</sup> environment and interfaced with in-house built algorithms, and Finite Element simulations are performed in DubalRFEM. An ecological island’s canopy has been completely redesigned with a Genetic Algorithm and a Dynamic Relaxation Algorithm, resulting in a free-form shape-resistant structure. Finally, the shape-optimized canopy meets various requirements (structural, functional, formal) that improve structural efficiency and design collaboration, such as in the role of the architect and engineer in the design process and in the relationship between the designer and design tools. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Mass reduction is a primary design goal pursued in satellite structural design, since the launch cost is proportional to their total mass. The most common mass reduction method currently employed is to introduce honeycomb structures, with space qualified composite materials as facing materials, into the structural design, especially for satellites with larger masses. However, efficient implementation of these materials requires significant expertise in their design, analysis, and fabrication processes; moreover, the material procurement costs are high, therefore increasing the overall program costs. Thus, the current work proposes a low-cost alternative approach through the design and implementation of geometrically-shaped, parametrically-defined metal perforation patterns, fabricated by standard processes. These patterns included four geometric shapes (diamonds, hexagons, squares, and triangles) implemented onto several components of a structural design for a conceptual satellite, with a parametric design space defined by two scale factors and also two aspect ratio variations. The change in the structure’s fundamental natural frequency, as a result of implementing each pattern shape and parameter variation, was the selection criterion, due to its importance during the launcher selection process. The best pattern from among the four alternatives was then selected, after having validated the computational methodology through implementing experimental modal analysis on a scaled down physical model of a primary load-bearing component of the structural design. From the findings, a significant mass reduction percentage of 23.15%, utilizing the proposed perforation concept, was achieved in the final parametric design iteration relative to the baseline unperforated case while maintaining the same fundamental frequency. Dynamic loading analysis was also conducted, utilizing both the baseline unperforated and the finalized perforated designs, to check its capability to withstand realistic launch loads through applying quasi-static loads. The findings show that the final perforated design outperformed the baseline unperforated design with respect to the maximum displacements, maximum Von Mises stresses, and also the computed margin of safety. With these encouraging outcomes, the perforated design concept proved that it could provide an opportunity to develop low-cost satellite structural designs with reduced mass. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Data-driven intelligent computational design (DICD) is a research hotspot that emerged under fast-developing artificial intelligence. It emphasizes utilizing deep learning algorithms to extract and represent the design features hidden in historical or fabricated design process data and then learn the combination and mapping patterns of these design features for design solution retrieval, generation, optimization, evaluation, etc. Due to its capability of automatically and efficiently generating design solutions and thus supporting human-in-the-loop intelligent and innovative design activities, DICD has drawn the attention of both academic and industrial fields. However, as an emerging research subject, many unexplored issues still limit the development and application of DICD, such as specific dataset building, engineering design-related feature engineering, systematic methods and techniques for DICD implementation in the entire product design process, etc. In this regard, a systematic and operable road map for DICD implementation from a full-process perspective is established, including a general workflow for DICD project planning, an overall framework for DICD project implementation, the common mechanisms and calculation principles during DICD, key enabling technologies for detailed DICD implementation, and three case scenarios of DICD application. The road map can help academic researchers to locate their specific research directions for the further development of DICD and provide operable guidance for the engineers in their specific DICD applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Surrogate models with structured data representations, mainly images and graphs, have been widely investigated in various domains, including automotive manufacturing. Despite advances, existing approaches still face significant challenges in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and generalisability. To address these challenges, a promising direction is to combine the advantages of both images and graphs. This study proposes a graph-based surrogate model, which has a multi-level architecture with enhanced graph convolutional operations using image-inspired spatial edge weights. To evaluate its performance, three additional graph-based surrogate models are developed for comparison, each differing in the formulation of spatial edge weights. All four models are assessed on a real-world hot-stamping B-pillar case study, which involves variations in blank shapes under multiple parameterisations and post-stamped thickness distributions exhibiting complicated local patterns. The proposed architecture significantly outperforms the three comparison models, achieving high accuracy with a relatively low computational burden during training and deployment. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong robustness in hyperparameter calibration and shows the potential for generalisation to other manufacturability-related real-time simulation problems. This study presents an effective methodology for future surrogate model development by integrating the advantages of different structured data representations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Traditional architectural design processes are caught in sequential and isolated planning workflows, starting with pen-and-paper sketching, digitizing, visualizing for stakeholders, and refining. Only after the basic design has been established, structural engineers get involved and modify the structure, such that the design withstands all external loads. This segregated approach is driven by knowledge barriers associated with structural analysis and by lengthy feedback loops regarding structural design decisions involving finite element simulations. This paper presents research on a novel collaborative and digital design framework, labeled as HeXA, that lowers this knowledge barrier and enables all stakeholders to actively participate in structural design decisions. HeXA couples architecture, structural and material mechanics, computer science and graphics, as well as robotics in six modules: (1) a sketching interface for architectural design, (2) a geometric modeling module that translates the sketch to finite element meshes, (3) a material modeling module that predicts the mechanical properties of sustainable bio-composites, (4) a structural analysis module that assesses the mechanical performance using finite element simulations, and (5) an extended reality environment's immersive visualization that is enhanced by (6) structural haptic feedback provided by a collaborative robot. This allows users to touch and push the envisioned structure in a virtual environment and experience realistic structural deformations provided by the robot and its arm in real-time while resulting stress fields are mapped onto the virtual structure. This way, architectural and structural design processes – particularly at the crucial early design stage – become collaborative, interactive, accessible, and responsive as demonstrated in the paper based on two use cases in theater stage design and building architecture. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Conventional design methodology for tall buildings is a time-consuming and repetitive trial-and-error procedure with a limited probability of yielding an optimal solution that satisfies architectural, structural and serviceability requirements. Tall buildings are typically slender structures and mainly depend on lateral load resisting systems (LLRS) (e.g., shear walls, cores, and bracing systems) to withstand the lateral load of earthquakes and wind events, where a minor change in their layout, size, or shape will affect the cost tremendously. Consequently, an automated layout optimization procedure will result in a more economic and sustainable design. This paper develops a novel structure-wind optimization framework (SWOF) to find the optimal shear wall layout of tall buildings subjected to wind loads. SWOF is considered a genetic algorithmbased framework that uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) surrogate model to evaluate its constraints and objective function. These surrogate models rely on a training dataset prepared using the Finite Element Method (FEM), which has been created using an open application program interface (OAPI) MATLAB code. An optimization problem; is presented to show SWOF's efficiency. SWOF showed significant capabilities in recognizing load direction, critical load cases and inertia concepts without explicitly defining them through the developed code. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of architectural design methods and structural analysis techniques, structural performance-based design approaches have become increasingly important in architectural design. Among these approaches, topology optimization is a significant design method. However, most existing topology optimization research and related applications are based on single-material topology optimization techniques, which have limitations when applied to the design of complex and challenging structures. Building upon our previously proposed multi-material bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (multi-material BESO) method, this paper presents the approaches for achieving diverse and competitive structural designs and then presents a practical application of the multi-material BESO method to the structural design of the core structure of a long-cantilevered building project called “Xiong'an Wings”. After an evolutionary design process based on the multi-material BESO method, an efficient frame with lower overall material costs, better static and dynamic performance compared to the initial design by experienced engineers is achieved. As the first practical application of the multi-material BESO method to a large-scale architectural design, the example of the “Xiong'an Wings” building demonstrates the tremendous prospects for the application of multi-material topology optimization technology to the generative design of innovative and efficient building structures. © 2023 The Author(s)},

This issue is exacerbated in the presence of nonlinear problems, where numerical iterations are generally needed. We propose a method that utilizes machine learning to generate a direct relationship between the element state and its forces, which avoids the complex task of finding the internal displacement field and eliminates the need for numerical iterations. To generate our model, we choose an existing finite element formulation, extract data from an instance of that element, and feed that data to the machine learning algorithm. The result is an approximated model of the element that can be used in the same context. Unlike most data-driven techniques applied to individual elements, our method is not tied to any particular machine learning algorithm, and it does not impose any restriction on the solver of choice. In addition, we guarantee that our elements are physically accurate by enforcing frame indifference and conservation of linear and angular momentum. Our results indicate that this can considerably reduce the error of the method and the computational cost of producing and solving the model.},

Both shell elements and brick elements are used to discretize the design domain, so that the effect of shell thickness can be accounted for during the form-finding process. The structural self-weight is taken into consideration due to its practical importance. The minimum thickness is constrained to improve the constructability of the obtained designs.

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">This paper describes the structural design, digital fabrication and construction of KnitCandela, a free-form, concrete waffle shell with KnitCrete, a falsework-less formwork approach using a custom prefabricated knitted textile as multi-functional, structural shuttering layer and a form-found cable net as the main load-bearing formwork. The digitally designed and fabricated textile provided integrated features for inserting and guiding elements such as cables and inflatables that helped shape the sophisticated mould. With a total weight of only 55 kg, the 50 m<sup>2</sup> formwork was easy and compact to transport. On site, the formwork was tensioned into a timber and steel rig, the pockets were inflated, and then coated with a thin layer of custom-developed, fast-setting cement paste. This paste served as a first stiffening layer for the textile, minimising the formwork's deformations during further concrete application. Fibre-reinforced concrete was manually applied onto the formwork to realise a 3 cm-thick shell with 4 cm-deep rib stiffeners. The novel approach, for the first time applied at architectural scale in this project, enables the building of bespoke, doubly-curved geometries in concrete, with a fast construction time and minimal waste, while also reducing the cost and labour of manufacturing complex parts.<br/></div> © 2020 Institution of Structural Engineers},

abstract = {This paper introduces topology finding of patterns for shell structures such as beam grids for gridshells or voussoir tessellations for vaults, among others. The authors refer to topology finding, by analogy and in complement to form finding, as the design of the connectivity of these patterns in order to follow architectural, structural and construction requirements. This paper presents a computational approach relying on a specific design space and data structures based on singularity meshes, which encode the information about the singularities in patterns. The designed patterns are structured, i.e. with a low number of singularities, can include high-valency pole points, and respect alignment to surfaces, curves and points. A feature-based exploration approach is introduced with a generation procedure for singularity meshes following the boundaries of a surface as well as point and curve features, using a topological skeleton or medial axis. These features can stem from statics heuristics, whose efficiency is assessed in a case study. A rule-based editing approach for singularity meshes supplements feature-based topology finding, using a grammar of strip rules as parameters to further explore the singularity design space. This conceptual design approach and its algorithms are an aid for topological exploration of patterns for shell-like structures by architects and engineers.<br/> © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},
